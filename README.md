# CALCULATE THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

## A weighted average is a calculation that takes into account the varying degrees of importance of the numbers in a data set.
## In calculating a weighted average, each number in the data set is multiplied by a predetermined weight before the final calculation is made.
## A weighted average can be more accurate than a simple average in which all numbers in a data set are assigned an identical weight.
